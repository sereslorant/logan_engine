# Test cases

## Test_GL3Renderer

This is the integration test for the GL renderer.
It checks whether the Renderer offers the functionality the engine needs in order to function properly.

## Test_GL3StaticMesh

This test checks whether the Static Mesh data structure loads properly.
We can observe the normal vectors and texture coordinates.

## Test_GL3SkeletalMesh

This test checks whether the Skeletal Mesh data structure loads properly.
We can observe the normal vectors and texture coordinates.
It also plays an animation so we can check whether the weights are loaded properly.
